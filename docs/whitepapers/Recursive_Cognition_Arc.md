# Recursive Cognition → Operators → Prosthetics

**Observation:** Reward hacking and confabulation are *expected* in nascent cognition.

**Design response:** Build a *middle layer* of small, auditable operators that enforce local constraints and can be composed into recursive ensembles:
- Tessellate conceptual space; zoom resolution to reduce “grey” to discrete decisions.
- Use competing axes (order/entropy) for stability, drawn from biology & physics.
- Express causality in legible specs (invariants, weights), not hidden heuristics.

**Endgame:** Assemble operators into agent collectives that act as **neurocognitive prosthetics**—symbionts that help users find balance and make better choices. (This repo is non‑clinical and research‑only.)
