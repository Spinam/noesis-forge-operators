# Code of Conduct

We’re committed to a welcoming, harassment‑free community for everyone. Be respectful, assume good faith, and keep feedback specific to ideas and code.

Unacceptable behavior includes personal attacks, harassment, doxxing, or discriminatory remarks. Project maintainers may take action (including removing content) to maintain a safe environment.

If you experience or witness a violation, please open a private security issue or email the maintainers.
